## SECTION B

### Introduction

Ethereum's reach and potential are unparalleled in the decentralized domain. Yet, scalability remains its Achilles' heel. We introduce VOCA - Verifiable Off-Chain Computations are Awesome!

VOCA's primary goal is to introduce a zk rollup, offering an immediate and transformative scalability solution for Ethereum. If successful, an ambitious extension toward a Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine (ZKVM) is envisioned, transitioning from a mere scaling solution to a foundational layer-2 network.

### Outline

VOCA's trajectory is methodically structured:

**Central Objective: Zero-Knowledge Rollup Development**

- **Transaction Aggregator:** Construct an off-chain mechanism for transaction collection and batching.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation:** Engineer a system to derive proofs that vouch for the integrity of batched transactions without revealing their particulars.
- **On-Chain Verifier:** Design a contract on Ethereum for the validation of these zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring security and authenticity.

**Aspirational Objective: Development of a Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine (ZKVM)**

After the zk rollup's successful deployment:

- **Minimalistic VM:** Draft and implement a virtual machine for diverse off-chain computations.
- **Zero-Knowledge Circuit Integration:** Seamlessly amalgamate zk-SNARK or zk-STARK circuits with the VM, anchoring its computations to on-chain verifiability.
- **Layer-2 Network Evolution:** Harness the zkvm to evolve from a scaling solution to an expansive layer-2 network on Ethereum.

### Background

The significance of Ethereum in today's decentralized landscape is unassailable. VOCA's dual approach addresses the pressing scalability issues while laying the groundwork for a more integrated, comprehensive solution in the form of a layer-2 network.

### Achievements

VOCA's immediate target is the successful deployment of a zk rollup. Subsequently, with favorable circumstances and outcomes, the ambition is to pioneer the creation of a comprehensive layer-2 network integrating the zkvm.

### Justification

Ethereum's scalability conundrum is a pressing concern. Through VOCA's zk rollup, we anticipate immediate alleviation. The envisioned zkvm extension represents a vision of the future, positioning Ethereum as an even more formidable force in blockchain technology.
